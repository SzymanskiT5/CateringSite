        <p class="lead">Catering for geeks people! My catering site was simulated to take orders in city of Szczecin.
            I connected orders with Google Maps API to handle distance between my kitchen and customers houses</p>

        <h1 class="font-weight-light">How it works?</h1>
        <p class="lead">You as a customer, you can order some diets, to indicated destination. My program is able to
            calculate
            distance between my localization and order localization. If is more than 5 km, you need to pay extra value
            for delivery. If it is more than 10 km, unfortunately we don't deliver :)
            We don't delivery in holidays and weekend, program handles it too.Your diet can start minimum 3 days from
            todays date. If you added properly some diets, you need to fill your data information and choose payment
            method.
            My program handles normal transfer and simulated API Przelewy24 payment gate. That was really much fun and a
            lot of
            changes was made here! I hope you enjoy! </p>
