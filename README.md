There are two terms, to make a checkout:
* There must be minimum one diet in a cart.

Customer has to fill all fields and choice payment option, after
that system sends email to user.

I made registration request to Przelewy24, but it can't be finalised without Przelewy24 shop account, but serializer looks working good ;)
This is how it looks like if you choose Przelewy24 payment:
